# Releasing Canonical JSON

Follow the [Package release standard](package-release-standard.md) for the shared
quality gate, changelog parsing, publication and retry behavior. Normal publication
does not require administrator setup, active branch protection or a ruleset,
GitHub's immutable-release flag, or external attestations. Existing repository
rules and permissions still apply.

The required CI check is **Package gate**. Maintainers rebase reviewed PRs into the
repository's dynamically discovered default branch. The release workflow reruns
the complete source CI gate on that resulting commit, checks out the event's exact
`github.sha`, and verifies local `HEAD` matches it. A PR SHA is never the promised
future release identity. The newest stable SemVer changelog record selects the
version and must agree with the release manifests. An Unreleased-only changelog
does not publish; keep work that is not ready under `## Unreleased`.

Exact pre-1.0 pins are required. Semantic-only App adoption, Engine/extension
implementation and Computation cutover remain separately gated tasks. A proposed
initial changelog record does not prove that the package was published.

## Artifact and consumer verification

The built ZIP installs as a dependency in a fresh no-dev/no-scripts/no-plugins/
classmap-authoritative Composer project. Its package repository points to that ZIP,
never a path checkout. Packagist is disabled for this PHP-only isolated consumer.
Manifested symbols and the shipped example run via its consumer autoloader. Archive
verification enforces the reviewed allowlist and excludes tests, tools, vendor and
development state. The semantic corpus and public manifests remain mandatory
release evidence.

## Publication evidence and recovery

The maintainer performs the initial Packagist submission. Its GitHub integration
then follows tags without a registry credential in CI. Confirm `package-released`
from the successful default-branch publication run and matching published stable
release, tag and source identity. Publication does not establish `release-verified`.
Before declaring that state or SDK/App adoption, a fresh independent verifier must
bind the exact published source/tag, archive digest, manifests, registry coordinate,
license/security and clean-consumer results in an external RELEASE-ATTESTATION.yaml.
The artifact and handoff must not invent their own final commit, checksum or
publication evidence. This attestation is separate from normal publication.

Use the current release workflow on the default branch to retry after correcting
the reported failure. Existing tags and releases must match their source identity
and are never moved, deleted or replaced. Later default-branch runs may verify a
published release on an ancestor; an unpublished tag can be completed only on the
exact event commit that passed the full gate. Only a confirmed HTTP 404 permits
creation; authentication, rate-limit and server failures never authorize creation.
A release with GitHub's immutable flag disabled remains platform-mutable; accepting
it for normal publication does not make it immutable. Fix defects with an unused
successor version. A green PR does not prove publication or independent verification.

## Optional administrator hardening

[Repository release setup](repository-release-setup.md) is an explicit optional
administrator action. `--check` only audits; `--apply` changes the managed settings;
adding `--dispatch` requests a release run after setup verification:

```bash
bash tools/configure-release-repositories.sh --check kumwe/canonical-json
bash tools/configure-release-repositories.sh --apply kumwe/canonical-json
bash tools/configure-release-repositories.sh --apply --dispatch kumwe/canonical-json
```

The release workflow does not change repository settings automatically. This helper
requires repository Administration access, and dispatch also needs Actions write
permission. Keep administrator credentials out of Actions. A setup audit or dispatch
is neither a normal publication prerequisite nor proof that publication succeeded.
