 * envelopes, idempotency records and persisted projections all retain a digest rather than the original
 * value. Those comparisons span processes and outlive the request that made them, so the encoding must not
 * depend on the order keys happen to sit in an array. String-keyed arrays are sorted before encoding, while
 * lists keep their positions because order means something there. The value space is deliberately narrow:
 * null, bool, int, float, string and arrays of those, and nothing else, so an object, resource or non-finite
 * float is refused instead of being digested into something that cannot be reproduced.
